## 📦 Dependency Management (Melos)

This project uses a Dart workspace with Melos. Dependencies must be added consistently across packages — do not edit each `pubspec.yaml` manually.

### Add a dependency to all packages

```bash
melos exec -- flutter pub add intl:^0.20.2
```

This runs `flutter pub add` in every package in the workspace.

More about Melos: https://melos.invertase.dev/

### Add a dependency to a specific package

```bash
melos exec --scope="worklog_studio" -- flutter pub add http
```

or manually:

```bash
cd apps/worklog_studio
flutter pub add http
```

---

### Update dependencies

```bash
melos exec -- flutter pub upgrade
```

See Dart workspaces: https://dart.dev/tools/pub/workspaces

---

### Important notes

- Keep shared dependencies (e.g. `intl`, `http`, `collection`) on the same version across all packages
- Do not add dependencies to the root `pubspec.yaml` — it is not used for resolution
- Use Melos to avoid version conflicts
